# Git Commit Log

[![Japanese README](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-ja-red)](./README.ja.md)

Logs all git commits into an org file.

## Background
I often struggle to remember what I did during a workday, but I need to recall my activities for
retrospectives, 1-on-1 meetings, and similar purposes. However, I find it difficult to take detailed notes
consistently. To address this, I thought that it would be best to automatically log my work.

Since my primary activity — programming — regularly involves committing to Git repositories, I began by logging all my
Git commits as an effective first step.
