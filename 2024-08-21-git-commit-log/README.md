# Git Commit Log

[![Japanese README](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-ja-red)](./README.ja.md)

Logs all git commits into a org file.

## Background
I often struggle to remember what I accomplished during a workday, but for retrospectives, 1-on-1 meetings, and similar
purposes, it's important for me to recall my activities. However, I find it difficult to consistently take detailed
notes. To address this, I decided that the best solution would be to automatically log my work.

Since my primary activity — programming — regularly involves committing to Git repositories, I began by logging all my
Git commits as an effective first step.
